Data Visualization Summary


This project includes several exploratory data visualizations to understand the structure and distribution of the dataset:

Missing Values Heatmap: A heatmap was used to identify missing values in the dataset. It provides a quick visual representation of null entries, helping to detect patterns or clusters of missing data.

Histogram of Age: A histogram was plotted to examine the distribution of ages. Custom bin ranges (20–40, 40–60, 60–90) were used to group the data, with black edges added to the bars for visual clarity.

Box Plot of Age: The box plot highlights the central tendency, spread, and potential outliers in the age data. It reveals the median age and gives insights into skewness and variability.

Scatter Plot (Age vs. Resting Blood Pressure): A scatter plot was created to explore the relationship between age and resting blood pressure (trestbps). This helps in identifying trends or correlations between the two variables.

Joint Plot (Age vs. Resting Blood Pressure): A Seaborn joint plot was used to provide both a scatter plot and histograms of the two variables on the axes, offering a more comprehensive view of their relationship and distribution.
