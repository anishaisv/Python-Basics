Project Summary: Outlier Detection in Medical Data Using Boxplots
This project analyzes a medical dataset to identify potential outliers in patient health indicators â€” specifically Urea and Creatinine (Cr) levels â€” using boxplots and basic data exploration techniques.

ðŸ”„ Summary of Steps Performed
Loaded the dataset to begin the analysis.

Renamed a column to improve clarity (No_Pation to Patient_id_no).

Checked for duplicate entries, confirming there were none.

Examined for missing values and handled them by dropping incomplete rows.

Visualized the Urea values using a boxplot to identify outliers.

Explained boxplot components and quartiles for easier interpretation.

Calculated the 99th and 99.5th percentiles of the Creatinine column to set outlier thresholds.

Identified records exceeding the upper threshold as potential outliers.

Plotted the Creatinine values with a boxplot to clearly display the distribution and outliers.

ðŸ“Š Key Takeaway
Boxplots offer a simple and effective way to visually detect outliers, helping to flag unusual medical values that may require closer attention.
